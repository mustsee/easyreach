    Hi Carolyn, this is Thomas, from the Princes Street Hostel, I hope you are well and thanks again for booking with us. Could you please let us know what time you will be arriving tomorrow ?
    Please bear in mind we are at the very top of our building and there are a quite a few steps to reach reception level.
